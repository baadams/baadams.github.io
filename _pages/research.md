# Research

Our work connects glaciers to the sea, encompassing water, sediment, and landscape evolution. Our diverse work, from building embedded electronics to augering for samples from past rivers and glaciers, is designed to be able to answer one key question: ***What drives and sets the pace and style of Earth-surface change?***

## River mechanics and geomorphic evolution

We work to find **physics-centered solutions** for how **river channels and watersheds evolve through time**. Our goal is geomorphic: to predict the results of landscape change. To do so, we develop theory and build mathematical and numerical models. We then test these against field data from modern and ancient settings, as well as against laboratory experiments, to improve our ability to predict both natural and human impacts on river and landscape change.
