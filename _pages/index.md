# Research interests 

Our research group takes a quantitative and multidisciplinary approach to examine the complex and competing influences of climate (e.g. rainfall and glaciation), tectonics (e.g. faulting and rock uplift), and surface processes (e.g. river incision, and volcanic deposition) on the evolution of landscapes around the world.

By integrating in-situ field observations with geochemical analyses, multi-modal remote sensing, machine learning, and numerical modelling, my research seeks to predict long-term (million-year) landscape responses to perturbations and short-term (decadal) impacts on land use and geologic hazards. 

# Come as you are

I am a mut from the US. Born in a working class family. I am an immigrant citizen of nowhere who goes where the good ideas take me. If that resonantes with you and you want to do some tectonic gemorphology, let me know.
